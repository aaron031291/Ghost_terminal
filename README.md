# Ghost_terminalSelf-Learning Loop – Grace Autonomous Engine

This module implements Grace’s self-learning and code correction feedback loop, enabling her to understand, fix, and improve code autonomously.

Purpose

Grace uses the SelfLearningLoop to:
	•	Run code in a secure kernel
	•	Detect errors during execution
	•	Match errors to known patterns
	•	Apply intelligent fixes
	•	Iterate until the code runs successfully or max attempts are reached

This creates an adaptive self-correcting engine for autonomous project building.

Features
	•	Error Pattern Matching: Uses regex to detect common Python errors.
	•	Fix Suggestion Engine: Automatically applies code fixes for:
	•	Missing delimiters
	•	Invalid syntax
	•	Undefined variables
	•	Missing imports
	•	Indentation errors
	•	Iterative Execution: Runs up to max_attempts and scores improvement.
	•	Grace Kernel Integration: Uses Grace’s secure CodeExecutionKernel for real execution and logging.

Key Classes
	•	SelfLearningLoop: Manages the training-feedback-fix cycle.
	•	LearningResult: Stores improvement details, error corrections, and execution logs.
	•	ErrorPattern: Internal pattern/fix engine for specific error types.
 from grace.learning import SelfLearningLoop

loop = SelfLearningLoop()
code = "print(Hello World"  # Broken code
result = loop.learn(code)

print(result) 
learning:
  max_attempts: 5
  error_threshold: 0.8
  success_threshold: 0.9
  learning_rate: 0.1
  Output
	•	Returns a LearningResult object
	•	Includes original code, improved code, fixed error list, and success score
