Summary: What’s Needed for 100% Production-Ready Grace Training Module
	1.	Robust Error Handling
Add try/except blocks around every file parser to avoid crashes on bad input.
	2.	Structured Logging
Replace print() with Grace’s internal logger to unify tracking and diagnostics.
	3.	CLI Command Support
Add --source and --save flags to Grace’s CLI so training can be launched like:
python -m grace.train --source ./docs --save memory.json
	4.	Smarter Querying
Replace naive string match with semantic scoring (e.g. 75% similarity threshold).
	5.	Snapshot Saving
Auto-save versioned training sessions to training_history/ with timestamps.
	6.	Training Report Output
Generate a summary report after training: how many files parsed, skipped, errors found, etc.

Would you like me to implement the full version with all 6 now?
